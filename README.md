# Predict Customer Subscription

A Portuguese banking institute conducted marketing campaigns through phone calls. The data collected through these campaigns were used to determine if the customer will subscribe to a term deposit. This kind of prediction will enable the bank in accessing their profit forecast and analyse if their marketing strategies are effective. The data collected consist of details of customers such as age, education, job, marital status, credit status etc. Based on these details, the analytical model was trained to predict if the customer would agree to start a term deposit in the bank. Analysing these results of the model, the bank can provide budget and profit calculations and also contact the expected customers in regard to the deposit plans. The model obtained after training the available dataset predicts the customers who will not subscribe 90% accurately. However, it does not predict the customers who can subscribe to the deposit. The reason for this false prediction is the less support data related to customers who have subscribed. A more balanced dataset would have solved this issue and provided more appropriate results.
